# Space Explorer Bot
Space Explorer is simple Messenger chat bot that uses NASA's API to get the data and images about the space and interact with the user accordingly.  

It's created for fun and also as a showcase for [Claudia Bot Builder](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia-bot-builder), node.js library for creating chat bots for various platform and deploying them on AWS Lambda.

## How to run and deploy it

### Prerequests:

- Create a new bot page in Facebook and a messenger app, as explained in the Facebook Messenger Getting Started Guide.

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository and run:

   ```
   npm init
   ```

2. Install `claudia` as a global utility, if you do not have it already:

   ```
   npm install claudia -g
   ```

3. Create a new bot in AWS. If you changed the name of bot.js file, change the `--api-module` argument below accordingly.

   ```
   claudia create --region us-east-1 --api-module bot
   ```

4. Configure Facebook Bot with a following command and follow the instructions:

   ```
   claudia update --configure-fb-bot --configure-app
   ```

   - `--configure-fb-bot` will prompt you for FB page access token and FB app secret (for message validation) and it'll print out your webhook URL;  
   - `--configure-app` will prompt you for the Nasa API key (Check https://github.com/stojanovic/space-explorer-bot/blob/master/bot.js#L181);

And that's it :)
